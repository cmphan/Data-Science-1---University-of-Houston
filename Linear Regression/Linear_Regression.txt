1. What is Linear Regression?
 	-Relationship between one dependent variable and explanatory variable(s)
	-Use equation to set up a relationship 
	-Use mainly for ESTIMATION and PREDICTION
2. What steps are involved in Linear Regression Model? 
	-Hypothesize Deterministic Component (Estimate Unknown Parameters)
	-Specify Probability Distribution of Random Error Term (Estimate Standard Deviation Error)
	-Estimate the FITTED Model 
	-Use Model for PREDICTION and ESTIMATION
3. What are types of Regression Models ? 

					    Regression Models 
					     /           \
					Simple	           Multiple
					 / \	           /      \
			  
			  	    Linear   Non-Linear  Linear  Non-Linear
	 -Simple : only 1 explanatory variable
	-Multiple: 2+ explanatory variable 
4. What is "best fit" ?
	-Best fit mean difference between actual y values & predicted y values are a minimum.
